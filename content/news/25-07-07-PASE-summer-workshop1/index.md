What happens when you bring together scientists from diverse fields, all committed to making research more inclusive and transparent? We explored that and more during the 2025 PASE Open Science Workshop, held June 16-18. Hereâ€™s a quick recap of what we covered on Day 1!

**Monday, June 16th, 2025 - Telling Your Science Story, facilitated by The Story Collider**

We opened our three-day Open Science workshop series in JG32 with facilitators from [The Story Collider](https://www.storycollider.org/), who highlighted the power of storytelling in science. Storytelling not only helps communicate findings and knowledge but can also reveal the
human side of research by sharing the passion and culture of those behind the work. 

Through brainstorming activities focused on character development, key events, and story
resolution, the workshop helped participants strengthen their storytelling skills. Emphasis
was placed on showing rather than telling to encourage a style that fosters empathy and
engagement from the audience.

The workshop concluded with performance tips followed by a story-sharing session, in
which volunteers presented the narratives they had developed throughout the day. It
offered an excellent opportunity for students interested in science communication to
practice and grow their skills in a supportive environment.

Thank you to everyone who joined us and contributed thoughtful questions, examples, and ideas. If you have any follow-up questions or want to get more involved, feel free to reach out to the PASE Executive Board at [pase@bme.ufl.edu](mailto:pase@bme.ufl.edu)!
