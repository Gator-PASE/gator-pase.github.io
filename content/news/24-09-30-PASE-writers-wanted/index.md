Want to get into policy writing, but short on time? Write for PASE!

<!--more-->

PASE is looking for members to contribute to our blog and newsletters!

This opportunity gives students a platform to develop and publish their own policy pieces without the time commitment of preparing an entire manuscript.

Interested? Contact [Zoe Schaefer](https://gator-pase.netlify.app/author/zoe-schaefer/) or the [PASE Executive Board](mailto:PASE@bme.ufl.edu) today!
