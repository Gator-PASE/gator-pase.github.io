What happens when you bring together scientists from diverse fields, all committed to making research more inclusive and transparent? We explored that and more during the 2025 PASE Open Science Workshop, held June 16-18. Here’s a quick recap of what we covered on Day 3 and what’s coming next!

**Wednesday, June 18th, 2025 - Open Science in Practice**

[Dr. Jamal Lewis](https://bme.ufl.edu/dept-member/jamal-lewis-ph-d/), Associate Professor in the UF Department of Biomedical Engineering, opened day three with on overview of the current state of academic research. He spoke about why research matters, especially in interdisciplinary and applied fields, and how we, as scientists, can continue to value and protect the role of science moving forward. He emphasized that science isn’t about perfection, it’s about progress, and about building a scientific community that’s accessible, accountable, and capable of moving forward together.

[Dr. Benjamin Johnson](https://www.jou.ufl.edu/staff/benjamin-johnson/), Director of UF STEM Translational Communication Center and Associate Professor of Advertising, followed with a practical introduction to open science tools and workflows. He walked through pre-registration, open data sharing, and registered reports, including examples and simple first steps. His overall message was that you don’t need to overhaul your research approach overnight — small, consistent actions, like documenting your plans early or uploading your survey instrument, can make your work easier for others to verify, build on, and trust.

**What’s Next**

PASE is looking forward to future collaborations that will integrate both community partnership and open science practices. More details will be shared soon via our newsletter and blog.

Thank you to everyone who joined us and contributed thoughtful questions, examples, and ideas. If you have any follow-up questions or want to get more involved, feel free to reach out to the PASE Executive Board at [pase@bme.ufl.edu](mailto:pase@bme.ufl.edu)!
