PASE is excited to announce the creation of three policy writing groups for the Fall 2024 semester!

<!--more-->

This initiative provides PASE Gators with hands-on experience identifying policy topics in a given BME research area and translating their scientific knowledge into fruitful science policy discussions, which may then develop into policy publications. The policy groups this semester are focused on Neural Engineering, Tissue Engineering, and Immunoengineering.

To hear more about what these groups have accomplished thus far, join us for PASEâ€™s [Fall 2024 Semester Showcase](https://gator-pase.netlify.app/event/2425-fall-gbm2/) on November 24th in JG32 at 12PM!

Interested in joining a policy writing group in the future or have ideas for next semester's research areas? Contact [Ava Burgess](https://gator-pase.netlify.app/author/ava-burgess/) or the [PASE Executive Board](mailto:PASE@bme.ufl.edu) today!
