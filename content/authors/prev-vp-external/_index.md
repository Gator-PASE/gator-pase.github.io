Ava is a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Brain Mapping Lab](http://brainmappinglab.org) under research guidance from Dr. Ayşegül Gündüz. Her primary research interests within Biomedical Engineering include Neural Engineering/Neuroengineering, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, with a primary focus on Neuromodulation techniques such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems towards understanding neurological disorders such as Epilepsy, Essential Tremor, Tourette's syndrome, etc. Her ultimate research goals are to impact the overall quality of life for patients with neurological disorders to relieve systems impeding life through better imaging techniques, instrumentation, therapeutics, and treatments.
