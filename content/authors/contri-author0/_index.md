Cameron is a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Stabler Diabetes Tissue Engineering Lab](https://www.bme.ufl.edu/labs/stabler/). He is currently studying the effects of supplemental oxygenation on the success of islet transplantation to treat type one diabetes. Due to his personal connection to the disease, he also has a passion for advocacy, specifically with respect to legislature that impacts funding of scientific research associated with type one diabetes and minimizing the costs of the medications needed to manage the condition.
