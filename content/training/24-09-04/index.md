**Interacting with Policymakers**

1. Understand your audience and tailor your commentary to them
2. Identify "windows of opportunity" for influence
3. Engage with real world policymaking! Don't wait for a "rational" and orderly process to appear

**The Basic Elements of a Policy Pitch**
- Name, town, and years you’ve lived in their district
- Occupation/what you do
- What networks or communities you represent
- What you are asking them to do (be specific — e.g., vote yes or no on a bill, cosponsor a bill, join a certain caucus)
- Why you care, and why you and your community want them to act (an anecdote can be helpful)

**Identifying Your Target Audience**
- Before you can pitch anyone, you need to know who you are pitching your policy to (who is your target audience?)
- *Power-mapping* is a tool used to identify your target audience and better prepare you for making policy recommendations
  - What needs to change first?
  - Where is that change made?
  - Who can enact that change?

**Researching Your Target**
1. What are their biggest interests and track record on your policy issue?
2. What do they stand to win by saying “yes”, or stand to lose by saying “no”?
3. Who can directly influence them? (personal and professional)
4. Whose support is especially important to them, and why?
5. What has prevented them from saying “yes” so far?

**Crafting Your Approach**
- What is the topic of your policy pitch?
- Who is your target? (name, office/role, background info.)
- What are their primary motivations, allies, and key issues?
  - 3-6 bullet points / sentences
- What is your angle or approach based on this research?
  - What is your connection to  this target?
  - How will you use your research of your target to shape your pitch?
- When is the most opportune time to pitch your target based on your research and the policy landscape?

**Power-Mapping Exercise**
- Download and complete our [power-mapping template](https://gator-pase.netlify.app/training/24-09-04/power-mapping-template.docx).
- After completing this exercise, ask yourself:
  - What is important for you to know about your target? How will you work that into your policy pitch?
  - Do you still feel that you chose the right target? Why or why not?
